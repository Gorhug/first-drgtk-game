# Target Practice

A simple game based on the tutorial/book [Building Games with DragonRuby](https://book.dragonriders.community/introduction.html).

Assets from:

* [Kenney](https://kenney.nl) (most graphics, sound effects)
* music and jingles from [8-Bit Action Music Booster Pack](https://bit-by-bit-sound.itch.io/8-bit-music-booster-pack) by Bit By Bit Sound
* [Jacquard 12](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jacquard+12) by Sarah Cadigan-Fried
* everything not mentioned (the dragon, other fonts, some other stuff) either from DragonRuby GTK or the tutorial mentioned above.
